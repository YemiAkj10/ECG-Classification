# ECG-Classification
Using KNN, DTC, LM, RFR to find optimum model for ECG classification

Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning models to analyze and derive insights from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. By employing a diverse set of machine learning techniques including KNearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifiers, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regressors, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations within the ECG data.

KNearest Neighbours allows us to classify ECG signals based on their similarity to neighboring data points, enabling precise classification of cardiac abnormalities. Decision Tree Classifiers offer interpretability by breaking down the decision-making process into a series of simple rules, aiding in the identification of key features affecting heart health.

Furthermore, Linear Regression provides insights into the linear relationships between various physiological parameters and ECG readings, facilitating predictive modeling of cardiac conditions. Finally, Random Forest Regressors offer robustness and accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees, enhancing the reliability of our predictive models.

By harnessing the power of these machine learning algorithms, our project seeks to advance our understanding of cardiac health and pave the way for innovative diagnostic and predictive tools. Through our research, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the field of cardiology while also gaining practical experience and expertise for future endeavors, including potential internships in the healthcare or biomedical industries
